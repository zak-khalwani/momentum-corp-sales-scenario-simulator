# 1. Business Context: The Momentum Corp. Case Study

This document provides a detailed background on the business drivers, strategic goals, and target audience for the Momentum Corp. Strategic Sales Scenario Simulator.

## Problem Statement

Momentum Corp., a major distribution company, conducts an annual operating planning (AOP) process to set financial targets for the upcoming fiscal year. This process was heavily reliant on complex, disconnected spreadsheet models and was often more art than science. The executive team faced significant challenges in building a data-driven plan:

*   **Lack of Agility:** Testing a new pricing or demand assumption required hours of manual adjustments in spreadsheets, stifling proactive analysis and debate.
*   **Difficulty in Target Setting:** It was challenging to justify sales targets. Were they too aggressive? Too conservative? The underlying assumptions were often opaque.
*   **Inability to Model Market Volatility:** The team could not quickly model the potential impact of external factors, such as a competitor's price increase or a forecasted economic slowdown affecting consumer demand.
*   **Strategic Disconnect:** It was difficult to translate a high-level strategic decision, like a 3% price increase, into a tangible revenue forecast that the entire organization could align behind.

## Project Goals & Objectives

The primary objective was to replace the cumbersome spreadsheet-based planning process with a dynamic, interactive Power BI simulator. The project aimed to:

*   **Build a Strategic "What-If" Engine:** Create a tool that allows leaders to model the top-down impact of universal pricing and demand assumptions.
*   **Provide Instant Feedback:** The simulator must recalculate the entire annual sales forecast in real-time as users adjust the input sliders.
*   **Enable Data-Driven Dialogue:** Shift the focus of planning meetings from building the numbers to debating the strategic assumptions, fostering a more productive and insightful discussion.
*   **Connect Strategy to Execution:** Provide breakdowns by store and customer to show how a high-level strategic decision would impact specific parts of the business.

## Target Audience

This dashboard is designed specifically for the senior leadership and strategy teams at Momentum Corp.:

*   **C-Suite (CEO, CFO, CSO):** To set and validate high-level financial goals for the annual plan.
*   **Head of Strategy / Corporate Development:** To model different market scenarios and assess company resilience.
*   **Sales & Commercial VPs:** To understand how top-down targets will translate into expected growth from their key customers and regions.
